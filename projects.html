            Revision is a Hacked Minecraft client that I wrote. It features a fully working event dispatch system for implementing code into the runtime as well as a debug system that maintains any errors that occur and 'ping' them to the user.

            NotBot is a player simulation bot that is used for OldSchool Runescape botting that simulates a normal players actions between actions. At the moment it is only available for the <a href="//www.runemate.com/botstore/">Runemate Spectre</a> client. The NotBotAPI requires the user to first 'record' themselves performing the action for a minimum of 10 minutes so that the program can create a unique user profile. The longer the user records themself performing the action the more lifelike the program becomes.

            I wrote an essay on the concepts of object orientated programming within Java a couple of years back. Although it's examples are centered around Java it's still adaptable to other programming languages.
