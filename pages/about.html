        <p>
            I've been programming in Java for <b>over 5 years</b> now; everything I know has been self taught. I started to become interested in Java when I became more interested in how games where made and how people could modify a game to how they wanted. The most popular game at the time was Minecraft and luckily the modding community for it was huge.<br><br> It started with making small <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1282203">mods/tweaks</a> for things that I wanted in the game. Whether it be a <i>chat-TAB autocompleter or an auto item refiller</i>, I started to expand my knowledge of Java. From there I found a couple of videos by a group called '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/teamavolition/">Team Avolition</a>' who were notorious in the Minecraft community for Griefing (<i>the process of annoying another player whether it be destroying their work or just generally being annoying</i>). <br><br>Within their videos they can be seen using something called a '<b>Hacked client</b>' which is basically an overall modification of the original Minecraft client to give yourself an advantage over the other players.<br> I started to research about this hacked client and then stumbled upon a forum called <a href="https://hackforums.net/">HackForums</a> namely the griefing section. I quickly created my own hacked client and started a name for myself in this community, this is where Java for me blew up and I learned so much from spending time there learning from others in the community.<br><br> I have been programming in Java ever since, adapting it to many day-to-day uses (<i>password creator, budget tracker, botting scripts and a message encrypter</i>).
